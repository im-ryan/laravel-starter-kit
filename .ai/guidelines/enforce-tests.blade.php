## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed.
- Prefer feature tests that outline the user experience and expected outcomes.
- Test coverage must always be 100%.
